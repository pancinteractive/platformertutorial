A Corona SDK tutorial for creating a platformer game.

Anatomy of a platformer

Making games is easy, and really hard. We all have ideas, and if you’re reading this, you’re most likely father along the road than most. You’ve at least identified Corona SDK as the best way to make your game a reality. Recommended reading are all of the CoronaLabs guides and T and G apps learning resources. 

If you would prefer to just get going without having to go through tutorials, DeepBlueApps has platformer templates for sale. 

Alright, for those that are still here, let’s talk about the platformer genre for a second. What do we need to make a platformer with Corona? Here’s a simple outline, and it describes how I’m going to structure this tutorial series:


I’m keeping it device-agnostic (assuming mobile) so any module that doesn’t natively detect the OS/device will most likely not be addressed. I want to use as few third-party tools so that I can show how strong Corona is without extraneous modules. This is going to be ongoing and I will add to it when I can. I am interested in doing an entry a week, and keeping them shorter and manageable.
